Even the numbers you take for granted are just a convention. Other  systems are possible, useful, and sometimes make more mathematical  sense. Usefulness depends on purpose! There are additive systems (e. g., ancient Egyptian, Roman, . . . )  and positional systems, each with various bases. Base 10 is for counting on your fingers (lat.: DIGITUS, finger → eng. digit, number) Base 60 is for easy calculation and and simple fractions. Base 2 is minimalistic and a smart technical and mathematical  choice. Just like in decimal, every base allows floating point fractions in  scientific notation to express approximated real numbers.

Even the numbers you take for granted are just a convention. Other  systems are possible, useful, and sometimes make more mathematical  sense. Usefulness depends on purpose! There are additive systems (e. g., ancient Egyptian, Roman, . . . )  and positional systems, each with various bases. Base 10 is for counting on your fingers (lat.: DIGITUS, finger → eng. digit, number) Base 60 is for easy calculation and and simple fractions. Base 2 is minimalistic and a smart technical and mathematical  choice. Just like in decimal, every base allows floating point fractions in  scientific notation to express approximated real numbers.

Even the numbers you take for granted are just a convention. Other  systems are possible, useful, and sometimes make more mathematical  sense. Usefulness depends on purpose! There are additive systems (e. g., ancient Egyptian, Roman, . . . )  and positional systems, each with various bases. Base 10 is for counting on your fingers (lat.: DIGITUS, finger → eng. digit, number) Base 60 is for easy calculation and and simple fractions. Base 2 is minimalistic and a smart technical and mathematical  choice. Just like in decimal, every base allows floating point fractions in  scientific notation to express approximated real numbers.

Even the numbers you take for granted are just a convention. Other  systems are possible, useful, and sometimes make more mathematical  sense. Usefulness depends on purpose! There are additive systems (e. g., ancient Egyptian, Roman, . . . )  and positional systems, each with various bases. Base 10 is for counting on your fingers (lat.: DIGITUS, finger → eng. digit, number) Base 60 is for easy calculation and and simple fractions. Base 2 is minimalistic and a smart technical and mathematical  choice. Just like in decimal, every base allows floating point fractions in  scientific notation to express approximated real numbers.

Even the numbers you take for granted are just a convention. Other  systems are possible, useful, and sometimes make more mathematical  sense. Usefulness depends on purpose! There are additive systems (e. g., ancient Egyptian, Roman, . . . )  and positional systems, each with various bases. Base 10 is for counting on your fingers (lat.: DIGITUS, finger → eng. digit, number) Base 60 is for easy calculation and and simple fractions. Base 2 is minimalistic and a smart technical and mathematical  choice. Just like in decimal, every base allows floating point fractions in  scientific notation to express approximated real numbers.
